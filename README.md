# Test Automation Framework

**Test Automation Framework** built using **C#**, **.NET**, **Selenium**, and **Reqnroll** (Cucumber-style BDD for .NET). 

------

Within this Test Automation Framework built using C#, .NET, Selenium, and Reqnroll
- The Page Object Model (POM) design pattern is used to represent each web page or UI component as a separate class.
- Element locators using Selenium WebDriver
- Reusable methods for interacting with the page (e.g. entering text, clicking buttons)
-  Abstraction of UI logic, keeping step definitions clean and focused on business behavior
